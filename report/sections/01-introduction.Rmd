# Introduction

The motivation for this project is to perform a predictive modeling process to the Credit data set. The first step in almost all data analyses is to understand and search for unique characteristics in the data set we will be working with. Gaining insight into the relationships among the multiple variables is essential in subset selection and prior knowledge into which variables are insignificant. After completing the section covering exploratory data analysis, the Credit data set will be processed to be prepared for model fitting, which includes centering/standardizing each variable column and dealing with categorical variables. The processed Credit data set is then split into training and test sets and thereafter, five different regression models are fitted to select the best model in accurately predicting the response variable Balance.
