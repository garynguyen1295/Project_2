# Conclusions
From the results of our analysis, we learned that Ridge regression method yield best predictions for `Balance` based on our observations on MSE value for each regression method. To increase the validity of the finding,  we should also look at how the estimated beta coefficients generated by this method fair with the ones created by other regression techniques. If we look at the chart from the 'Results' part, we can see that Ridge's beta coefficients are fairly consistent with the ones generated by LASSO, OLS and PLSR. That solidifies our finding that Ridge Regression yield the best predictions.
