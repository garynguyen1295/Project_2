# Predictive Modeling Process
## Author: Timothy Park & Gary Nguyen

The purpose of this project is to extend the scope of a multiple regression analysis to one with many more flexible models, which will cover shrinkage and dimension reduction methods. This analysis will reproduce the regression performed in Chapters 5 and 6 from the book, "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et al)". To reproduce the experiment, please use the following commands:
	make cleanall: clean all outputs
	make dataall: does all data download/processing
	make all: produces the outputs of the analyses

code: contains the functions to run the scripts and tests that would be used to check for working functions and to produce the outputs in the pdf report

data: contains the Credit raw data set, its variations, and other data objects sourced from running the scripts

images: contains the png images run by the scripts that display various plots in the predictive modeling process

LICENSE: contain the license information under Apache 2.0

Makefile: contains the command line instructions to maintain the reproducibility of the assignment

project_handout.pdf: contains the instructions of the project for reproducibility

report: contains the report files, which is the main output for this assignment

session-info.txt: contains information about the library packages used, R version, platform, and operating system of the user
